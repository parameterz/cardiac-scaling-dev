**Ratiometric Scaling in Echocardiography \- An Anachronism in the Era of Precision Medicine** 

**To the Editor:** 

In the era of precision personalized medicine, ratiometric scaling is an anachronism. 
Almost without exception, measurements of chamber and vessel size in the modern echo lab are "normalized" to the patient in the same way: by indexing to body surface area (BSA).
Most commonly, the BSA equation used for this purpose was published in 1916¹. Within a few decades, Tanner showed fundamental problems with scaling methods based on BSA ratios². It is not that this BSA equation is an antique; there are more modern equations. It is not that BSA is flawed as a scaling variable, though it is imperfect. The real problem lies within the indiscriminate application of the ratio. 

Indexing or ratiometric scaling (dimension = constant × BSA) fundamentally assumes linear relationships passing through the origin of a plot (0, 0), fitting straight lines through curved biological data. Such approaches can only be accurate at the single point where the line intersects the curve, typically representing population averages. This mathematical constraint means that our current methods are inherently biased against patients who deviate from the average body habitus, the very patients who most need personalized assessment. 

The clinical consequences of these mathematical constraints are profound. For example, using the recent MESA reference data³, left ventricular (LV) mass values can be generated using two approaches: (1) calculating mass from scaled BSA-indexed wall thicknesses and dimensions via the ASE formula, and (2) applying published LV mass index reference ranges directly. The same underlying measurements simultaneously predict opposite male-female relationships depending on the scaling method employed.   

This type of contradiction pervades echocardiographic scaling. Tricuspid valve perimeter/BSA favors females while tricuspid valve area/BSA favors males⁶. Similarly, WASE data shows females have larger BSA-indexed LVOT diameters and larger velocity-time integrals, yet smaller BSA-indexed stroke volumes than males⁷. These geometric impossibilities—where the same cardiac structures yield contradictory size relationships through different scaling approaches—suggest our measurement methods may be creating rather than revealing demographic differences. 

An interactive laboratory has been developed (available at \[website\]) that allows practitioners to explore these mathematical contradictions using published reference data. The tool demonstrates how contradictory relationships can be created depending solely on scaling method, providing evidence that our approach to current "normal" ranges may reflect mathematical convenience rather than biological reality. 

The situation becomes even more stark when we consider that modern medicine can sequence genomes, predict drug responses based on genetic variants, and deploy machine learning for personalized risk assessment. We have computational tools capable of multivariable modeling to account for the complex, non-linear relationships between body habitus and cardiac geometry. Yet, we persist with simple ratios that create systematic biases. 

Encouragingly, recent publications demonstrate the feasibility of superior approaches. Shiwani et al. developed demographic-based personalized left ventricular wall thickness thresholds using multivariable modeling⁴, while Lauzon-Schnittka et al. created pediatric Z-scores adjusted simultaneously for body size, BMI, and age⁵. These studies exemplify precision medicine principles applied to cardiac measurement. 

The upcoming Chamber Quantification Guidelines present an opportunity to move beyond these ratiometric limitations. Rather than perpetuating scaling methods that create mathematical impossibilities and potential biases, we should focus on dimensionally sound approaches: allometry, multivariable prediction models, and individualized assessment tools that respect cardiac geometry. 

The contemporary echo lab, with advanced imaging equipment and AI-driven analysis, represents a marvel of technological progress. The promise of personalized medicine is within reach. It is time to let go of the past and embrace rigorous approaches that better serve the diversity of our patients and match the sophistication of our imaging.
