# Cardiac Scaling Analysis Laboratory

An interactive educational platform for exploring cardiac measurement scaling approaches across different methodologies. This tool provides factual, data-driven comparisons of traditional ratiometric indexing with allometric scaling approaches, allowing users to understand the implications of different scaling choices.

## üî¨ Scientific Framework

The tool implements the scaling theory framework described by Dewey et al. and Gutgesell & Rembold, applied to the comprehensive reference dataset published by Strom et al. from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).

### Four Scaling Approaches
1. **Ratiometric BSA**: Current clinical standard (linear indexing to BSA)
2. **Allometric LBM**: Biological scaling using lean body mass
3. **Allometric BSA**: Geometric scaling using body surface area  
4. **Allometric Height**: Pure geometric scaling using height

### Measurement Categories
- **Linear (1D)**: Dimensions, diameters, thicknesses
- **Area (2D)**: Chamber areas, valve areas, cross-sectional areas
- **Mass/Volume (3D)**: Tissue masses, chamber volumes, flow rates

## üöÄ Quick Start
